We are given a row wise sorted matrix of size r*c, we need to find the median of the matrix given. It is assumed that r*c is always odd.


Algorithm:

First we find the minimum and maximum elements in the matrix. Minimum element can be easily found by comparing the first element of each row, and similarly the maximum element can be found by comparing the last element of each row.
Then we use binary search on our range of numbers from minimum to maximum, we find the mid of the min and max, and get count of numbers less than our mid. And accordingly change the min or max.
For a number to be median, there should be (r*c)/2 numbers smaller than that number. So for every number, we get the count of numbers less than that by using upper_bound() in each row of matrix, if it is less than the required count, the median must be greater than the selected number, else the median 
must be less than or equal to the selected number.



// C++ program to find median of a matrix 
// sorted row wise 
#include<bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 

const int MAX = 100; 

// function to find median in the matrix 
int binaryMedian(int m[][MAX], int r ,int c) 
{ 
	int min = INT_MAX, max = INT_MIN; 
	for (int i=0; i<r; i++) 
	{ 
		// Finding the minimum element 
		if (m[i][0] < min) 
			min = m[i][0]; 

		// Finding the maximum element 
		if (m[i][c-1] > max) 
			max = m[i][c-1]; 
	} 

// KEY STEP
	int desired = (r * c + 1) / 2; 
	while (min < max) 
	{ 
		int mid = min + (max - min) / 2; 
		int place = 0; 

		// Find count of elements smaller than mid 
		for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) 
			place += upper_bound(m[i], m[i]+c, mid) - m[i]; 
		if (place < desired) 
			min = mid + 1; 
		else
			max = mid; 
	} 
	return min; 
} 

// driver program to check above functions 
int main() 
{ 
	int r = 3, c = 3; 
	int m[][MAX]= { {1,3,5}, {2,6,9}, {3,6,9} }; 
	cout << "Median is " << binaryMedian(m, r, c) << endl; 
	return 0; 
}
